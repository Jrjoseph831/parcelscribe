## What you need
- Tracking number and delivery date
- Photos: box exterior, label, inner packing, and damaged item
- Proof of value (invoice, receipt, or order confirmation)
- If insured: declared value or insurance info

## Steps
1. Photograph the box, label, packing, and damage before moving anything.
2. Gather proof of value and confirm declared value/insurance.
3. File the UPS claim online; keep the narrative short and refer to attached photos.
4. Keep packaging available in case UPS requests inspection.
5. Respond to any UPS follow-up within 24 hours with missing documents.

## Common mistakes
- Only showing the damaged item without packaging photos
- One blurry photo instead of a clear set
- No proof of value attached
- Throwing away packaging before closure

## What to upload
- Photo set: box, label, packing, damage (multiple angles)
- Proof of value PDF or clear screenshots
- If applicable: declared value/insurance evidence

## Example claim narrative
"Package tracking 1ZXXXX was delivered on 01/05 visibly crushed. Attached photos show the box, label, inner packing, and item damage. Proof of value is attached. Please reimburse the item value; packaging is retained for inspection."
