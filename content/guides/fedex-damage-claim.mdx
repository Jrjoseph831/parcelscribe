## What you need
- Tracking number and ship/delivery date
- Photos: box exterior, label, packing, and damage
- Proof of value (invoice/receipt)
- Any delivery notes or inspection tags

## Steps
1. Photograph the box, label, packing, and damaged item from multiple angles.
2. Collect proof of value and any delivery notes.
3. Submit the FedEx claim with a brief summary; reference attached photos.
4. Keep packaging until FedEx confirms closure or waives inspection.
5. Reply to FedEx requests within a day and add missing documents promptly.

## Common mistakes
- Only one photo or none of the inner packing
- Submitting without proof of value
- Waiting for the recipient to respond before filing
- Discarding packaging too early

## What to upload
- Photo set (box, label, packing, damage)
- Proof of value PDF or screenshots
- Delivery notes or door tags if present
