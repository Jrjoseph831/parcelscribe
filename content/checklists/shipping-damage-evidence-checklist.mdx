Use this checklist before you submit a damage claim.

## Items to capture
- Full box exterior with label visible
- Close-up of the shipping label and tracking number
- Inner packing and cushioning (before moving items)
- Damaged item from multiple angles
- Proof of value (receipt, invoice, or order confirmation)
- Proof of shipment (label PDF, manifest, or drop-off receipt)
- Weight or dimensions if relevant
- Timeline summary of when damage was found

## Quick tip
Keep the box and packing until the carrier closes the claim or says an inspection is waived.
